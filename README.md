# Data-Science-Portfolio

A repository containing a sample of my data science projects.

Each project is a Jupyter notebook. <b>For a superior viewing experience</b>, consider following the links in this README rather than clicking on the files in the repo directly. The former will take you to Jupyter's excellent nbviewer, while the latter will render the notebook directly in github (often buggy).

## Projects

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Costa%20Rican%20Household%20Poverty%20Level%20Prediction.ipynb'>Costa Rican Household Povety Level Prediction</a>: Trained and tuned supervised learning algorithms to classify Costa Rican households by level of financial need. Kaggle competition hosted by Inter-American Development Bank.

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Fish%20Market%20Classification.ipynb'>Fish Market Classification</a>: Used labeled fish market dataset to evaluate the performance of sklearnâ€™s clustering algorithms. Gaussian mixture model prevailed over k-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering in separating species. For evaluation, used dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to construct 2D visualizations. Also compared unlabeled clustering score (silhouette) to labeled (adjusted Rand Index).
