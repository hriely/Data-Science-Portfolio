# Data-Science-Portfolio

A repository containing a sample of my data science projects.

Each project is a Jupyter notebook. <b>For a more aesthetically pleasing experience</b>, consider following the links in this README rather than clicking on the files in the repo directly. The former will take you to Jupyter's excellent nbviewer, while the latter will render the notebook directly in github.

## Projects

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Customer%20Segmentation%20Via%20RFM%20and%20Clustering.ipynb'>Customer Segmentation Via RFM and Clustering</a>: Computed RFM (recency, frequency, monetary value) score for each customer using online retail records. Constructed customer segments using DBSCAN and k-means clustering, comparing their performance.

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Costa%20Rican%20Household%20Poverty%20Level%20Prediction.ipynb'>Costa Rican Household Povety Level Prediction</a>: Trained and tuned supervised learning algorithms to classify Costa Rican households by level of financial need. Kaggle competition hosted by Inter-American Development Bank. The data was very messy, so brace yourself for some hardcore cleaning!

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Fish%20Market%20Classification.ipynb'>Fish Market Classification</a>: Used labeled fish market dataset to evaluate the performance of sklearnâ€™s clustering algorithms. Gaussian mixture model prevailed over k-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering in separating species. For evaluation, used dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to construct 2D visualizations. Also compared unlabeled clustering score (silhouette) to labeled (adjusted Rand Index).

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Mount%20Rainier%20Climbing%20EDA.ipynb'>Mount Rainier Climbing Data Visual Exploration</a>: EDA on Mount Rainier Climbing data taken from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/codersree/mount-rainier-weather-and-climbing-data'>Kaggle</a>.

- <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hriely/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Seattle%20Airbnb%20EDA.ipynb'>Seattle Airbnb Data Visual Exploration</a>: EDA on Seattle Airbnb data taken from <a href='http://insideairbnb.com/'>Inside Airbnb</a>.
